# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. I've never read an academic paper before. Can I come?

Absolutely! One of the organizers started reading papers by starting Papers we
love. We will help you get started.

## 2. I haven't read the paper yet. Should I come?

We strongly urge you to go through the paper once before the meetup. It usually
leads to a better understanding of the subject and even livelier discussions.
Every speaker is happy to see attendes with soiled paper printout filled with
notes and drawings.

If you haven't been able to read it, we still strongly encourage you to attend
the meetup. You will still learn a lot.

## 3. How do I start reading papers?

There is a [lot of information][read 1] out there on [How to read a research
paper][read 2] but this one by [Science Magazine][science] is particularly
useful. Note that reading scientific papers becomes easier with experience, so
hold on.

1. Get a print out. It's an effective way to stay focused on the task.
1. Read the abstract carefully.
1. Skim through the introduction.
1. Read the conclusions.
1. See the references if there is a concept you aren't familiar and you need
   additional reading materials.
1. Try to read the paper in multiple passes such that you don't spend too long
   on something you don't immediately understand. Sometimes the concept might
   get explained in detail further ahead.
1. Take a lot of notes. Underline what you think is important. This makes
   subsequent reading much simpler.
