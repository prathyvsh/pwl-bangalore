These differences are required because distributed systems require that the programmer be aware of latency, have a different model of memory access, and take into account issues of concurrency and partial failure.</p> <p>We look at a number of distributed systems that have attempted to paper over the distinction between local and remote objects, and show that such systems fail to support basic requirements of robustness and reliability. These failures have been masked in the past by the small size of the distributed systems that have been built. In the enterprise-wide distributed systems foreseen in the near future, however, such a masking will be impossible.<br/>We conclude by discussing what is required of both systems-level and application-level programmers and designers if one is to take distribution seriously.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Please try to read the paper upfront and come with all your questions and scribbled &amp; spoiled print outs :)</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>We try to start on time.

Application of this is abundant today: from Apple X's Augmented Reality applications, 3D Facial Recognition to latest news today Google Pixel use of Depth in images to create bokeh/Portrait images. Projective Geometry is the bread and butter of 3D Computer Vision. During this talk, we will see how Projective Geometry allows us to model the imaging process of a camera. Projective Geometry allows much more richer transformations than just translation and rotation possible in Euclidean Geometry. We will discuss how we can use Projective Geometry for various Computer Vision Problems: like Stereo, 3D Reconstruction etc.</p> <p><b>It is a Joint session of Bangalore Computer Vision Meetup and PWL group.</b></p> <p>Speakers</p> <p><br/><b>Mr. Sumod Mohan</b>, CTO - Digital Aristotle &amp; Head - CVD, Soliton Technologies</p> <p><b>Mr. Shivarajkumar Magadi</b>, R&amp;D Lead - CVD, Soliton Technologies</p> ",

    "description": "<p><b>Abstract</b>: <i> Eventual consistency aims to ensure that replicas of some mutable shared object converge without foreground synchronisation. Previous approaches to eventual consistency are ad-hoc and error-prone. We study a principled approach: to base the design of shared data types on some simple formal conditions that are sufficient to guarantee eventual consistency. We call these types Convergent or Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).</i></p> <p><b>Reference Paper</b>:  <a href=\"http://hal.upmc.fr/inria-00555588/document\">A comprehensive study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types</a></p> <p><b>Overview</b>: Replication is a fundamental concept of distributed systems. Any data update must be replicated to all peers in the system, if the system were to behave like a single system. This is usually achieved  by introducing coordination, but it is expensive and can become infeasible quickly. An alternative approach is to build systems that are eventually consistent by removing coordination from the hot path, but there can be conflicts and conflict resolution is generally complex. </p> <p>CRDT's are any data structures (and associated operations) that have some simple mathematical properties. These properties are immensely useful in building distributed systems that are eventually consistent and conflict free by design. There are may known CRDT's and the paper listed above catalogs them. While CRDT's are not general purpose, a lot of real life problems can be solved by using CRDT's. </p> <p><br/>In this talk, I hope to cover everything needed from the ground up, including the rudimentary mathematics needed to understand CRDT's, walk through some of the data structures and prove that they are CRDT's, discuss problems that can be solved with CRDT's, their practical limitations, along with a general discussion/rant on distributed systems, consensus and consistency models. </p> <p>- Vipin</p> ",

There have been many efforts to integrate static and dynamic typing and thereby combine the benefits of both typing disciplines in the same language. The flexibility of static typing can be improved by adding a type Dynamic and a typecase form. The safety and performance of dynamic typing can be improved by adding optional type annotations or by performing type inference (as in soft typing). However, there has been little formal work on type systems that allow a programmer-controlled migration between dynamic and static typing. </p> <p>\n\n\n In this paper we present a solution based on the intuition that the structure of a type may be partially known/unknown at compile-time and the job of the type system is to catch incompatibilities between the known parts of types. We define the static and dynamic semantics of a λ calculus with optional type annotations and we prove that its type system is sound with respect to the simply-typed λ calculus for fully-annotated terms. We prove that this calculus is type safe and that the cost of dynamism is pay-as-you-go.</p> ",

    "description": "<p>Shriram is back at Bangalore and has agreed to give a talk on 17th Jan, Sunday evening.</p> <p>Unlike other meetings, we *do not* have any reading material. Come with an open mind.</p> <p>Talk Abstract:</p> <p>The Recurring Rainfall Problem</p> <p>Soloway's Rainfall problem, a classic benchmark in computing education research, has proven difficult for many CS1 students.  Rainfall tests students' abilities at plan composition, the task of integrating code fragments that implement subparts of a problem into a single program. Nearly all prior studies of Rainfall have involved students who were learning imperative programming with arrays.  In our recent multi-university study, students learning functional programming produced atypical profiles of compositions and errors on Rainfall. What do these different results suggest about the problem of plan composition and programming education?</p> <p>This talk raises various questions about the relationships between programming languages, program design, curricula, and how students perceive code structure.  I'll describe results from both our earlier Rainfall study and some work-in-progress that attempts to further tease apart these relationships.  The talk assumes no experience with either functional programming or having been rained upon.</p> <p>Joint work primarily with Kathi Fisler.</p> <p>A bit of rambling from a meetup organizer. Please tolerate.</p> <p>The only expectation from attendees is to click the right RSVP button once. That's all. How hard is it to be not a jerk? This time, for Shriram's convenience we booked a 3/4 ★ hotel conference room near his accommodation. It is costing someone real money to give you a good space. It is very difficult to plan anything when attendees act without any consideration for the people who try to do good for them. If you are not coming, please RSVP no.</p> <p>Its alright when a large office is hosting it. InMobi had a lot of space and even if the number goes up or down, we don't care. We will be able to manage. Not when we book a hotel for a fixed number of people. Please don't make me say this after every meetup</p> <p>1. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriram_Krishnamurthi\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriram_Krishnamurthi\" class=\"linkified\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriram_Krishnamurthi</a></a></p> <p>2. <a href=\"http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/\"><a href=\"http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/\" class=\"linkified\">http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/</a></a></p> ",

    "description": "<p>I will be talking about Hyperloglog, a cardinality (i.e. number of distinct elements) <i>estimation</i> algorithm. In general, counting the number of elements in a set gets harder as the number of sets increase. For e.g., you might want to count number of users from a country.. i.e. number of sets is just 200+ and you can use a map of country to count. But, if you want to count the number of unique visitors to a popular website, then the number of sets become really large.</p> <p>Probabilistic counting methods give a way to estimate the cardinality of sets without keeping track of every single item. Hyperloglog is probably the best known of those methods. </p> <p>Paper: <a href=\"http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf\"><a href=\"http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf</a></a></p> ",

No matter whatever high level abstractions you create for talking about these primitive bits (floats, points, lines, boxes, polygons, fish), as long as you are writing programs that work with state, you are bound to run into this combinatorial explosion as you add complexity. We humans are really bad at keeping track of states in our heads! An average person can keep <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two\">7 ± 2</a> things in his/her working memory. What we are good at though, is <i>narratives and descriptions</i>...</p> <p><br/>The timeless paradigm of functional programming emphasizes thinking of programs as consisting of pure functions akin to mathematical identities. This decouples programming from the idea that programs have to be written for a computer, and as a series of instructions. Instead, in FP, we <i>describe</i> the world and the system we want to create in terms of its constituent parts, which, in turn, are similarly <i>described</i> in terms of their constituent parts.</p> <p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p> <p>Peter Henderson's \"Functional Geometry\" simply provides an example of a well-written functional program. In particular, the author builds a sequence of functions which start off by describing lines on a 2D plane and build up to a description of an intricate <a href=\"http://www.mcescher.com/\">Escher</a> woodcut called <a href=\"http://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/square-limit\">Square Limit</a> (final result in the figure). In the process, the author offers insights into how to write other such well-written functional programs.</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/2/0/a/600_432021002.jpeg\" /></p> <p><i>                                    A 600x600 grid of bits!</i></p> <p><br/>In this session we can plan to discuss:</p> <p>\n\n• Primitives for describing geometry of lines on a 2D plane</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node29.html\">Abstraction barriers</a>, and layered design of a richer set of functions (the fish and its poses)</p> <p>• The description of Square Limit</p> <p>• An implementation of a system to draw the primitives</p> <p>• History of this paper, and how other notable works make references to it</p> <p>• (Discussion) concrete lessons you can apply in your day-to-day programming - I am expecting this discussion to be a blast!</p> ",

Some of the more popular use-cases for such algorithms are leader election, distributed locking, distributed log replication and so on.</p> <p>Paxos was originally presented by Leslie Lamport in a very entertaining paper (that was rejected for publication many times). However, generalized Paxos is considered extremely hard to implement. </p> <p>Raft was born as a easy to understand consensus algorithm and had several implementations to its credit. </p> <p>In this session, I am planning to go over the problem of distributed log replication, walk through Paxos and its derivatives and then go through Raft.

Starting with the familiar method of unit testing</p> <p>- An alternative mode of testing: invariance testing. Introducing QuickCheck. Include other motivations for invariance testing (from the model-checking world... successfully used in hardware and driver testing)</p> <p>- Work through the paper</p> <p>- Real-world uses of QuickCheck in Haskell packages (vector, lens, etc)</p> <p>- Integration with unit tests and cabal (if people are interested)</p> <p>- and ... pointing to further reading</p> <p>Let me know what you guys think.</p> <p>Thanks,</p> <p>Naren</p> ",
