## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. I've _never_ read an academic paper before. Can I come?

Absolutely! One of the organizers started reading papers by starting Papers we
love. We will help you get started.

### 2. I couldn't read the paper upfront before the meetup. Should I come?

We strongly urge you to go through the paper before the meetup. It usually leads
to a better understanding of the subject and livelier discussions. Every speaker
is happy to see attendees with soiled paper printout filled with notes and
drawings.

If you haven't been able to find time to read it, we still encourage you to
attend the meetup as these talks are meant to provide an accessible introduction
to the subject matter. Even if you have just skimmed the paper, you will still
learn a lot.

### 3. How do I start reading papers?

There is a [lot of information][read 1] out there on [How to read a research
paper][read 2] but this one by [Science Magazine][science] is particularly
useful. Note that reading scientific papers becomes easier with experience, so
hold on.

1. Get a print out. It's an effective way to stay focused on the task.
1. Read the abstract carefully.
1. Skim through the introduction.
1. Read the conclusions.
1. See the references if there is a concept you aren't familiar with and you need
   additional reading materials.
1. Try to read the paper in multiple passes so that you don't spend too long
   on something you don't immediately understand. Sometimes the concept vaguely introduced in the beginning might
   get explained in detail further ahead.
1. Take a lot of notes. Underline what you think is important. This makes
   subsequent reading much simpler.

### 4. What kind of papers are discussed usually?

We've had a wide range so far and you can see the full list in [the talks
page](./talks). Some of the easier ones were [a note on distributed
computing][note] by [Indradhanush Gupta][dhanush] and [understanding how Shazaam
works][shazaam] by Arpit Mohan. Sometimes we got into [Quantum
computing][quantum] and fancy consensus algorithms like [Raft][raft].

### 5. I've been reading a few papers recently and I'd like to present at the meetup.

Great! Get in [touch with us](twitter) or fill up the [talk form][form] and
let's start talking.
